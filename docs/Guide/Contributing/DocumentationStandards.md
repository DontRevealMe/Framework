# Documentation Format

This contains everything you'll need for the documentation standards.

## What you'll need

- [MarkdownLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- A text editor that supports MarkdownLint

## Documenting a method/function

Generally, methods and functions will be documented inside of tables. We try to follow Roblox's standard as much as possible here. Any extra info on the argument should be placed after it.

```md
``returnType`` :MyFunction(``string`` myArgument, ``Variant`` myOptionalVariant=``defaultValue`` ``[optional]``) ``[yields]``
```

For example:

``Vector3`` :GetSize(``Instance`` model, ``Variant`` myOptional=``3`` ``[optional]``)

``number`` :GetAsync(``string`` scope, ``integer``, ``integer`` amount=``4`` ``[optional]``) ``[yields]``

## How to document a library

Libraries generally follow a documentation strucutre of:

```md
# TITLE

DESCRIPTION

## API

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| ``type`` myName ``[internal]`` | ... |

| Function Name | Description | Returns |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| ``returnType`` myFunction(...) ``[internal]`` ``[optional]`` | ... | If you have more information on the return type, put it here. |

```

Include anything else such as examples after the API section. Anything after should be titled too using ``##``.

## How to document a class

Documenting classes is similiar to documenting libraries but we change the names up.

```md
# TITLE

DESCRIPTION

## API

| Property Nane | Description |
|---------------|-------------|

| Method Name | Description | Returns |
|-------------|-------------|---------|

```

Same ideas as documenting libraries. If you want to add more, add it after the API section ie code examples. Stuff that should appear before the API section should be stuff like limitations, warnings, and etc...
It's also optional to add more information such as a more detailed section describing each method/function:

```md

### Functions

#### :GetAsync()

| ``table`` :GetAsync(``string`` url) ``[yields]`` |
|-------------------------------------|
| Gets the body of the url. |

```
